PL/SQL 
-------
PL/SQL is a programming language used for managing data in databases. It combines SQL for data manipulation and procedural features for building applications. Itâ€™s like a toolkit that lets you efficiently interact with and control your Oracle database.

PL/SQL is a block structured language that enables developers to combine the power of SQL with procedural statements.All the statements of a block are passed to oracle engine all at once which increases processing speed and decreases the traffic.

FEATURES:
1. IT provides functionality or decision making, iterations
2. It can be execute number of queries in one block using single command
3. Provides an exception handle feature
4. Application written in plsql are portable to computer HW or OS where Oracle is operational.

STRUCTURE:
DECLARE

BEGIN
    executable statements
